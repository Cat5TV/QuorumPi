# QuorumPi
Proxmox Quorum server for Raspberry Pi

This tool allows you to boot up a Raspberry Pi single board computer to provide quorum to a Proxmox cluster containing an even number of servers. Proxmox requires an odd number of servers for High Availability clusters (HA) so QuorumPi provides quorum without the need of an odd server (for example, you can now have HA with only 2 servers).

You don't need to build it yourself. Instead, download the ready-to-deploy image from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EFLabdQOiJ4gtEZNoe3EgxWI5o9RNgr-/view?usp=sharing
